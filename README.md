# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work 
with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used 
for later analysis.

The project requires to submit:
1. a tidy data set
2. a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

The data for the project was downloaded from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This repository contains:
* CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
* run_analysis.R: R script to transform raw data in a tidy data set.
